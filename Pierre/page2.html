        <h2> 1970 – 1980</h2>
    

    <h3>From social to the advertising country</h3>
    <br>
    In the 1970s, advertising was king. Pierre Bernard summarizes well the history of this 
    supremacy in the interview with Forme-Vive: The Anglo-Saxon countries have had a much more 
    harmonious evolution, much slower with graphics. It is much more deeply embedded in their 
    societies than it is in ours. On our side, advertising became advertising through Savignac's 
    work essentially - who was a leader and a very funny guy, a kind of genius a little anarchist 
    as we like them here in France. For me he put a stop to the development of graphics." Cassandre 
    was beaten by Savignac" and I think it's a shame: it made us take a considerable delay."

    <br>
    <br>
    Bernard and his friends are committed to counter-current against the "sweet poison of advertising"
     by proposing posters in areas where the budget is scarce. Associations, cultural, social, 
     communist commitment... Grapus defends small voices. At the same time, the three friends taught 
     at Arts Deco. They come up against minimalist, strict and straight Swiss graphics, in the service 
     of rules and Queen Advertising.
     <br><br>
     In opposition to this style and more generally to the pre-established rules, Grapus is 
     committed to serving a cause which is dear to him, with this artistic desire of "gratuitous and 
     impulsive act", which is opposed to a paid graphics, serving advertising. Art versus graphics. 
     The impulse against the rules. Social causes versus lucrative causes. The style of the collective 
     resides in a united collaboration of the 3 and soon 10 members, intellectuals with childlike traits 
     and a playful aspect. The texts are almost always written by hand, the trembling drawings resemble 
     children's drawings, offering an overall tone that almost denotes and swears with the photography 
     used then in advertising, and of course with the Swiss movement. The artists play with textures, 
     words, colours.
     <br><br>
    Once again, the Libération comic book sums up the creative and collaborative climate well.

    <h3>Anti swiss graphic design</h3> 

     <br>
     In an interview published by Téléréma, Pierre Bernard tells us 
     the Grapus positioning, the opposite of Swiss graphics.
     <br><br>
     <i>« In 1970, when we started teaching, we wanted to talk about everything, 
     because we were carried by this energy of knowledge of images, of construction, of deconstruction.
    The Swiss don't talk about anything. Jean Widmer, I had him as a teacher, and he was a good teacher. 
    But Widmer, working with him was.... a few moves. Absolute silence and, simply, it took your gaze on 
    the form where it was needed, but without a word. Or such banal words. The subjects were also banal. 
    Advertising. So that was the breaking point between his teaching and us, Grapus. We said: there is not 
    only the product in life, we can talk about theatre, cinema, emotions... And there, at Arts Deco, 
    between the Swiss and us, it was a little tense. With Widmer, we learned a skill, and it was an 
    excellent thing. It's crafts and we don't discuss the rules. While at Grapus, all we enjoyed was 
    discussing the rules to see if they were valid. To see if they were serving a class interest that
    wasn't ours. »</i>
