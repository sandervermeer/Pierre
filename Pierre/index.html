    <h3>The Training Years</h3>
 
    Trained in Deco Arts, he co-founded the Grapus collective at the end of the 1960s 
    with his friends François Miehe, Gérard Paris-Clavel, Jean-Paul Bachollet and Alex Jordan. 
    This fine team has totally reinvented "public utility graphic design" in the space of twenty years,
    collectively creating thousands of images committed, enraged, funny, powerful, poetic...
    <br>
    <h3>Poland and Henryk Tomaszewski</h3>
    In 1964-65, Pierre Bernard and his acolyte Gérard Paris-Clavel - 
    who became another founding member of Grapus with François Miehe - discovered Poland, 
    then part of the Soviet bloc. Pierre is hired as an intern by Henryk Tomaszewski who teaches 
    him cultural graphics and the art of the sense of the graphic message.
    <br>
    
    It was Michel Quarez who had left the previous year on an internship there who had brought the
     "Polish" virus back to the Arts Deco. It must be said that Tomaszewski's work was impressively 
     modern and energetic (see pictures below). His creations, very strong and colorful, fight for 
     the independence of graphics and cultural message, at the time of Stalinism and Polish 
     socialist realism. Pierre Bernard had just taken his first shot of CMYK.
     <br>
    He will then become aware, thanks to his Polish'Master' that: "A poster is the taking possession
     of a public message by an individual (...). It is a public object that belongs to him 
     intimately, since it is his creation. It is the individual investment in an act of collective 
     exchange".

     <h3>Bauhaus in the Mai 68 country</h3>
     In 1967, Bernard was a student at Arts-Déco. There he met his two friends and future 
     collaborators. With the events of May 68, the three men meet in the popular workshops, 
     where the students of Fine Arts and Deco Arts create "visual contests" and produce every 
     day thousands of posters for the popular struggle.

     <h3>The Grapus years</h3>
        In 68, the French government realized that the Bauhaus movement had fallen through 
        the cracks in France, and decided to install the teaching members of the Bauhaus in 
        Ulm Street (the German city) who found themselves at that time without subsidies. 
        The Institut de l'Environnement was born, in which the three men found a place where 
        they could continue to explore alternative forms of expression and question submission 
        to the commission. If this type of place of collective creation has already been 
        experimented since the 1950s by the Americans of Push Pin Studios, or in the 1960s 
        by the Spanish antifrench painters of Equipo Crónica, then the Institute of the Environment 
        proposes a new way to make coincide political commitment and graphic creation.

         <br>
        In this political and communist environment, described as'Stalinist' by his opponents, 
        Bernard, Paris-Clavel and Miehe founded Grapus, a contraction of'Stalinist Crapule', 
        crap-stal and'graphic artist'.
